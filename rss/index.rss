Thus, as lottery winners become accustomed to the additional pleasures made possible by their new wealth, these pleasures should be experienced as less intense and should no longer contribute very much to their general level of happiness." - &lt;a href="https://pages.ucsd.edu/~nchristenfeld/Happiness_Readings_files/Class 3 - Brickman 1978.pdf"&gt;Lottery Winners and Accident Victims: Is Happiness Relative?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2019/01/Pavlov-Corbis.jpg" alt="emotion resistance training"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can see the justification that it may be inconsiderate or socially unacceptable for those with such few burdens to bear, issues to worry about to wear a low baseline of happiness on their sleeves. After all, a vast majority of the world's population endures so much more the former may not even be able to fathom. Though controversial, I can also understand the pleas of emptiness, numbness in those raised in privileged environments. Can they really be put to blame for the backgrounds they inherited through fate?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The less you have, the higher the capacity for novelty in your life. The more the possibility for exciting new thrills, for sights and sounds so grandiose they may seem fictional, for experiences that make you tear up dumbfounded. A child gazes at a waterfall differently than a well-travelled adult does. The first taste of sushi tastes worlds apart from that of the hundredth, thousandth bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emotions hit us less hard as we age, as we encounter similar experiences repeatedly and become more well-versed in the many facets of life. I guess this explains the loss of a childlike sense of wonder in adults as we feel and process more and more of the entire emotion spectrum. Some of us endure great periods of grief and melancholy, some of us snooze in comfort coasting through life with little to no challenge at all. Those in the former, despite their hardships, have much to look forward to, to aspire towards, to hope whereas those in the latter, undeniably fortunate, do not have this privilege. Those who "have it all", particularly through circumstance at a younger age, may feel a sense of hopelessness for the lack of experiences left to live, for the loss of excitement for a new day, if they've already enveloped much of what life has to offer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'd like to stay optimistic and hope that there is no way a person may go through every nook and cranny of emotions and experiences life has to offer. Two trips to a country may evoke completely different emotional responses from one to another. A part of me though is skeptical. Sometimes a successive trip abroad seems not as exhilarating only because it is no longer the inaugural. A following visit to a restaurant may no longer feel as astonishing simply because of this lack of novelty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this emotion dilution inevitable for us all?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering intense emotions strongly associated with happiness, relationships come to mind. In the realm of romance too, will the thrill, the infatuation after that of one's first relationship be less intense, less fluttering than the foremost? Entering this new and exciting notion of a relationship, our happiness soars. We have the time of our lives, try to adjust and balance all these feelings of obsession, sleeplessness, pure unadulterated joy cherishing this new person deeply entrenched in the our lives, compassionate about us in incredible capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even before the next, within the span of a single relationship, as we become more accustomed to all these sensations and feelings, do these feelings become more diluted over time, regardless of who the significant other is? Do we stop valuing it as much, stop valuing how much they care, how much they matter? After the initial euphoria in a first love, have we depleted our potential for the purest form of an intensely charged first love for the rest of our lives?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of me is accepting of this bittersweet fact, that the anticipation, the fervor, the anguish of a first love are emotions that are once-in-a-lifetime, that memories will last but emotions will come, be felt, and then fade away forever. Ephemerality gives these moments meaning. Part of me is even grateful for emotion dilution; we end up becoming more resistant towards not just positive but also negative stimuli, transitioning our personalities toward more disaffected but collected ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe what I call emotion dilution is just what others have been calling wisdom all along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>do understand</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Everything here represents brief periods of lowest lows and highest highs.&lt;/p&gt;

It is unlike a sharp but fleeting bee sting, but a sort of dull ache, one that lingers on and on incessantly. It saps your energy during the day and exchanges your capacity to escape away into your dreams at night with an insufferable gift of unwelcome restlessness. It drains away your capacity for compassion until you're left with a silhouette of a person, devoid of all characteristics human. It is a horrible feeling, grief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I think I do tend to romanticize grief, and may even resonate better with those of us who have fared into the lower deep ends of the happiness spectrum.  I find it is often than not the case that who have overcome periods of grief end up being more compassionate, more tolerant, with a tinge of melancholic wisdom that allows them to be more empathetic when others encounter pain of similar or less intensity, and recognize that no matter how hopeless a situation may seem to be when viewed locally, time and tide wait for no man.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title>intimacy</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I wish I could read your mind.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The older I grow up the more I find unnecessary clutter to confound me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acquisitiveness — the wish to possess as much as possible of goods, or the title to goods — is a motive which, I suppose, has its origin in a combination of fear with the desire for necessaries. I once befriended two little girls from Estonia, who had narrowly escaped death from starvation in a famine. They lived in my family, and of course had plenty to eat. But they spent all their leisure visiting neighbouring farms and stealing potatoes, which they hoarded. Rockefeller, who in his infancy had experienced great poverty, spent his adult life in a similar manner. […] However much you may acquire, you will always wish to acquire more; satiety is a dream which will always elude you. - Bertrand Russell&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'You have your way. I have my way. As for the right way, the correct way, and the only way, it does not exist.' - Friedrich Nietzche&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've grown to theorize that all it takes to pass my subjective threshold of self-awareness is being able to recognize how conceited our innate selves tend to be. We are preconditioned to view our own selves as protagonists of our own stories, and a lot of us fail to witness that the rest of society are too walking around with themselves as the main characters of their own. As long as we see those connected to us as side characters whose identities are extensions of our singular self, we are unable to process their true nature of being, their motivations and intentions stemming from their rich and complex roots; this hinders us from the eye-opening truth that we are less significant than we warrant ourselves to be. This fact alone is enough for us to develop deeper curiosities about the back stories of our associates for we can now fathom the existence of their hidden origins, the tales of their pasts that have shaped their progression of identity to reach their current state of self. It encourages and boosts a humble inquisitiveness, humble for we stay grounded acknowledging we are all equally deserving for the role of the titular character and inquisitive for we can now perceive the grander story, one that encompasses those written in the first person, and interestingly,  the intricate chains and edges may link all of them together, sometimes even unseemingly so. This recognition is all it takes to solve many of our most human issues including means of effective multilateral communication because we now hold the potential for multiple points of view to reside in our minds and a genuine and earnest appreciation for and empathy towards the humanitarian cause. Yet it is so rarely found amongst persons, as it is a mindset that usually develops only past a state of an unexpected melancholic awakening, a situation where one is forced to come to terms with the futility of his or her being in the larger picture after enduring a period of intense anguish or grief. Usually only past this internal blockage does the fully formed human being emerge victorious, not only because he or she has now crossed this mental person-specific ordeal that marks a true coming-of-age rite of passage, but also as he or she has now developed the cognizance of being able to reflect back on an identity lacking this newfound closer connection to true impartiality. He or she who has triumphed can now flash back through and realize how narrow a scope the past self had viewed the world with. In the simplest of words, this change is an invisible but prominent temperamental enlightenment, enabling the wielder to perceive, live in and cross seamlessly between dimensions broader than those granted by default. Effortlessly without an ulterior motive, the self-aware radiate and revel in a sort of pseudo-omniscience, grasping a wider spectrum of frequencies and now capable of cherishing the beauty of this kaleidoscopic gradient. It is truly the closest to a superpower attainable by the soul.&lt;/p&gt;

Yet maybe it is in the nature of the self-proclaimed old soul, to realize how repetitive it can be, to witness how the sunsets in two different trips and countries can seem dissimilar only to the superficial eye. Viewing a sunset, I get filled with a certain calmness, a feeling of waldeinsamkeit...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waldeinsamkeit (German): a feeling of solitude, being alone in the woods and a connectedness to nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And each subsequent visit, this sensation remains, but it is no longer novel; the awe and wonder subside ever so slightly each time. How uncanny it is that despite the synonymity of the words new and novel, new adventures aren't always novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes me ponder, as I age, do I keep searching for novelty in experiences or do I stay on the lookout for it in emotions instead? Either way, it's not like the two are always independent of one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other emotions I think all persons, genetically endowed innately the capacity to feel, should have the privilege of sensing at least once in his or her own lifetime:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iktsuarpok (Inuit): the feeling of anticipation when you're expecting someone that leads you to constantly check to see if they're coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiraeth (Welsh): homesickness mixed with grief and sadness over the lost or departed, or a type of longing for the homeland or the romanticized past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flâner (French): the art of leisurely strolling the streets of a city without any goal or destination simply for the pleasure of soaking up the city's beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudade (Portuguese): the feeling of longing for something or someone that you love which is lost. This feeling of emptiness, melancholy or nostalgia is often considered characteristic of the Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese temperament, although it also entered Galician Spanish with the same spelling. It is a bittersweet, empty feeling of something or someone that is missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toska (Russian): at its deepest and most painful, it is a sensation of great spiritual anguish, often without any specific cause. At less morbid levels it is a dull ache of the soul, a longing with nothing to long for, a sick pining, a vague restlessness, mental throes, yearning. In particular cases it may be the desire for somebody or something specific, nostalgia, love-sickness. At the lowest level it grades into ennui, boredom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyggelig (Danish): a warm, friendly, cozy, delightfully intimate moment or thing. It gives off imagery of a candlelit winter evening at home with warm blankets and maybe a bit of alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To devote parts of it to others, to carve it out willingly understanding its unforgiving and absolute nature, means much more than any present that can be nicely wrapped with a ribbon and delivered over the course of a singular moment. Its presentation may not be conspicuous nor may the underlying purpose of its sharing be pure, but at the heart of it I still believe it's the one quality most closely linked to affection in all its distinct meanings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why stop at 5, 10 minutes? If you don't will yourself to power through a mere 20-minute run, how else are you going to tackle the more difficult challenges of life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why stop at 5, 10 minutes? If you don't will yourself to power through a mere 20-minute run, how else are you going to tackle the more difficult challenges of life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activity couldn't be more irrelevant; it's the mindset. I don't want to have to rethink my entire worldview from the bottom up. The comfort zone is addictive and there's nothing wrong with desiring simplicity. I understand the temptation of testing your absolute limits, at every split second you force yourself for a little bit more but is this a marathon that will ever end? It's an over-glorification of gravitas, a struggle without an actual destination and if you're one to find these triumphs ordeals then the intended purpose of internal fulfillment becomes rather obsolete. It's the appreciation of the journey that justifies these tribulations to which not all have the itch for, and this disparity defines what separates those internally driven for an Ouroboros of fulfilling their self-prophecy and those unable to form such a cycle and break down, for external motivation does not at all suffice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's easy to see what's optimal for growth and it's definitely not for the faint of heart to muster the discipline to align principle with practice but is it what should be striven for because it is the more arduous path? I don't think it's really such a tragedy to opt for the easy way out; it's all perspective and conformity is underrated. A simple life with a caring family and kids, a meaningful job, a creative outlet and a healthy lifestyle, is it all that wrong to just blend in?&lt;/p&gt;
