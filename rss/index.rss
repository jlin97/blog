&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The older I grow up the more I find unnecessary clutter to confound me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acquisitiveness — the wish to possess as much as possible of goods, or the title to goods — is a motive which, I suppose, has its origin in a combination of fear with the desire for necessaries. I once befriended two little girls from Estonia, who had narrowly escaped death from starvation in a famine. They lived in my family, and of course had plenty to eat. But they spent all their leisure visiting neighbouring farms and stealing potatoes, which they hoarded. Rockefeller, who in his infancy had experienced great poverty, spent his adult life in a similar manner. […] However much you may acquire, you will always wish to acquire more; satiety is a dream which will always elude you. - Bertrand Russell&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'You have your way. I have my way. As for the right way, the correct way, and the only way, it does not exist.' - Friedrich Nietzche&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've grown to theorize that all it takes to pass my subjective threshold of self-awareness is being able to recognize how conceited our innate selves tend to be. We are preconditioned to view our own selves as protagonists of our own stories, and a lot of us fail to witness that the rest of society are too walking around with themselves as the main characters of their own. As long as we see those connected to us as side characters whose identities are extensions of our singular self, we are unable to process their true nature of being, their motivations and intentions stemming from their rich and complex roots; this hinders us from the eye-opening truth that we are less significant than we warrant ourselves to be. This fact alone is enough for us to develop deeper curiosities about the back stories of our associates for we can now fathom the existence of their hidden origins, the tales of their pasts that have shaped their progression of identity to reach their current state of self. It encourages and boosts a humble inquisitiveness, humble for we stay grounded acknowledging we are all equally deserving for the role of the titular character and inquisitive for we can now perceive the grander story, one that encompasses those written in the first person, and interestingly,  the intricate chains and edges may link all of them together, sometimes even unseemingly so. This recognition is all it takes to solve many of our most human issues including means of effective multilateral communication because we now hold the potential for multiple points of view to reside in our minds and a genuine and earnest appreciation for and empathy towards the humanitarian cause. Yet it is so rarely found amongst persons, as it is a mindset that usually develops only past a state of an unexpected melancholic awakening, a situation where one is forced to come to terms with the futility of his or her being in the larger picture after enduring a period of intense anguish or grief. Usually only past this internal blockage does the fully formed human being emerge victorious, not only because he or she has now crossed this mental person-specific ordeal that marks a true coming-of-age rite of passage, but also as he or she has now developed the cognizance of being able to reflect back on an identity lacking this newfound closer connection to true impartiality. He or she who has triumphed can now flash back through and realize how narrow a scope the past self had viewed the world with. In the simplest of words, this change is an invisible but prominent temperamental enlightenment, enabling the wielder to perceive, live in and cross seamlessly between dimensions broader than those granted by default. Effortlessly without an ulterior motive, the self-aware radiate and revel in a sort of pseudo-omniscience, grasping a wider spectrum of frequencies and now capable of cherishing the beauty of this kaleidoscopic gradient. It is truly the closest to a superpower attainable by the soul.&lt;/p&gt;

Yet maybe it is in the nature of the self-proclaimed old soul, to realize how repetitive it can be, to witness how the sunsets in two different trips and countries can seem dissimilar only to the superficial eye. Viewing a sunset, I get filled with a certain calmness, a feeling of Waldeinsamkeit...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waldeinsamkeit (German): a feeling of solitude, being alone in the woods and a connectedness to nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And each subsequent visit, this sensation remains, but it is no longer novel; the awe and wonder subside ever so slightly each time. How uncanny it is that despite the synonymity of the words new and novel, new adventures aren't always novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes me ponder, as I age, do I keep searching for novelty in experiences or do I stay on the lookout for it in emotions instead? Either way, it's not like the two are always independent of one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other emotions I think all persons, genetically endowed innately the capacity to feel, should have the privilege of sensing at least once in his or her own lifetime:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iktsuarpok (Inuit): the feeling of anticipation when you're expecting someone that leads you to constantly check to see if they're coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiraeth (Welsh): homesickness mixed with grief and sadness over the lost or departed, or a type of longing for the homeland or the romanticized past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flâner (French): the art of leisurely strolling the streets of a city without any goal or destination simply for the pleasure of soaking up the city's beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudade (Portuguese): the feeling of longing for something or someone that you love which is lost. This feeling of emptiness, melancholy or nostalgia is often considered characteristic of the Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese temperament, although it also entered Galician Spanish with the same spelling. It is a bittersweet, empty feeling of something or someone that is missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toska (Russian): at its deepest and most painful, it is a sensation of great spiritual anguish, often without any specific cause. At less morbid levels it is a dull ache of the soul, a longing with nothing to long for, a sick pining, a vague restlessness, mental throes, yearning. In particular cases it may be the desire for somebody or something specific, nostalgia, love-sickness. At the lowest level it grades into ennui, boredom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyggelig (Danish): a warm, friendly, cozy, delightfully intimate moment or thing. It gives off imagery of a candlelit winter evening at home with warm blankets and maybe a bit of alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To devote parts of it to others, to carve it out willingly understanding its unforgiving and absolute nature, means much more than any present that can be nicely wrapped with a ribbon and delivered over the course of a singular moment. Its presentation may not be conspicuous nor may the underlying purpose of its sharing be pure, but at the heart of it I still believe it's the one quality most closely linked to affection in all its distinct meanings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why stop at 5, 10 minutes? If you don't will yourself to power through a mere 20-minute run, how else are you going to tackle the more difficult challenges of life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activity couldn't be more irrelevant; it's the mindset. I don't want to have to rethink my entire worldview from the bottom up. The comfort zone is addictive and there's nothing wrong with desiring simplicity. I understand the temptation of testing your absolute limits, at every split second you force yourself for a little bit more but is this a marathon that will ever end? It's an over-glorification of gravitas, a struggle without an actual destination and if you're one to find these triumphs ordeals then the intended purpose of internal fulfillment becomes rather obsolete. It's the appreciation of the journey that justifies these tribulations to which not all have the itch for, and this disparity defines what separates those internally driven for an Ouroboros of fulfilling their self-prophecy and those unable to form such a cycle and break down, for external motivation does not at all suffice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's easy to see what's optimal for growth and it's definitely not for the faint of heart to muster the discipline to align principle with practice but is it what should be striven for because it is the more arduous path? I don't think it's really such a tragedy to opt for the easy way out; it's all perspective and conformity is underrated. A simple life with a caring family and kids, a meaningful job, a creative outlet and a healthy lifestyle, is it all that wrong to just blend in?&lt;/p&gt;
</content:encoded></item><item><title>disoriented</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I woke up from my occasional nap yesterday and completely lost my sense of purpose. The norm may be to attribute it to a biological reaction to the disorientation from the body's typical circadian rhythm but I think there's more to it.

The norm may be to attribute it to a biological reaction to the disorientation from the body's typical circadian rhythm but I think there's more to it. I think there are two potential possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mind is clear and hence empty. This allows me to rid my thoughts of anything else that may prompt me to desire to perform specific activities (i.e. a recollection of the need to stay financially secure may motivate me to finish my responsibilities of work). In this sense, this expulsion of such clouds of judgment allow me to with clarity see beyond the tunnel vision of all subjective perspective and understand that regardless of whatever I do, it is all pointless in the end. In the grand scheme of things, it doesn't matter how positively or negatively I impact my surroundings, how I influence my immediate or extended circle because ultimately it all means little to nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mind is clear and hence empty, empty from the necessities of life that I have to take care of within the short time span that I have left to experience and enjoy. Each of us assigns our individual lives our own sense of meaning and it is the individual responsibility to decide how much our lifespans' entirety we utilize meaningfully. The objective is not comprehension of our purpose within the cosmos but happiness, not ephemeral bouts of hedonistic pursuits but long-lasting content within the span of our lives, and the means to this end is to simply to do what keeps us truly happy within the short decades to century that we are fortunate to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nap has either expanded my scope to see the futility of it all or has narrowed my scope to blind me from my ambitions, dreams and desires. Either way I think it's a very interesting state of mind to be in, and definitely implores further experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

Regardless of time scale, there's always been much going on in our environments and in the world, but it's this era in which the culture of sharing and presentation has been promoted to the extent that it's hard to recall a time or two where I was ever so slightly bored, a privilege I miss now for it emerges out of a restlessness that instigates the desire to explore. We as a whole are bound to a stream of perpetual updates and refreshes of curated emotions and situations in the hopes that one or two may hit us with a dopamine release that temporarily satisfies our craving for instant gratification. It's become insidious deep within society and it's taught us to partake in the 'me' mentality of showcasing / overexposing our lives, our achievements, our day-to-day mundanities. Our growing addiction to social media is a topic that has been beaten to death but I really wish we'd be more cognizant of the fact that human connection could use a disconnect every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;
