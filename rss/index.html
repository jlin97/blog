Understanding your mind gives a surface level understanding of how people function and despite how useful that alone is, it is not sufficient. Only when we entrench ourselves deeply within those around us with backgrounds and perspectives so foreign to us and wholly take in their beliefs as valid do we gain a more comprehensive understanding of the concept. The shattered illusion will enable us to see how easy it is for ourselves to gain a flavor of self-awareness that is wrapped around our worldview and growth emerges only when we separate it from our ego. We have to be receptive to the possible truths within the unknown. It is unsettling and jarring as we have been partaking in the act of reflection for so long after all that it would be far easier to dismiss what is beyond our accepted set of values as ignorance or rationalize them as mere byproducts of dysfunctional systems and environments in order to preserve the effort of the core convictions we have strove so intently and patiently to build. It is upsetting to have to acknowledge what had been so evidently true from a certain angle or context as a misconstruction of reality but once the seal is broken there is no turning back. To continue peace of mind we must adapt to maintain internal consistency of what we value and respect and from the discomfort of adaptation will fortuitously emerge more tolerance and compassion in the end.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[boundaries]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>It seems more so the feeling that’s been consuming me most of all the different emotions I’ve been feeling in recent memory is that of overwhelm.

To some degree, I feel I’ve lost my sense of self, my sense of understanding of life around me. Just until a couple months ago, I had such a firm grip on my own values, my convictions and now everything just feels shaky. I do have faith in myself in rebuilding and my own structures and processes in re-making sense of all things, to recalibrate what I now perceive balance to be based on all I’ve been taking in. Yet, I keep ingesting more than I can organize and process, an imbalance in and of itself. I wonder where it stems from, from a skewed work/life balance? Love/life balance? Perhaps the imbalance is rooted in how deeply I need to process things, or that I am taking in too much. I’m working on letting go, and yet I still have to remind myself to not veer off of that extreme and frolic down the path of childish naivety either.</p><p>This lack of internal homeostasis detracts from my peace of mind, and doesn’t do well for my ability to appreciate the present either. Each new article or headline brings with it a tinge of anxiety from the fact that it is adding to an already lengthy list of information to digest. Talks with friends feel less so like unloading and working through situations than taking on more, being that my internal sense of self is already so frazzled. I find myself being unable to muster my normal charisma and enthusiasm for my own life or theirs; I cannot take in any more than I am already doing now. The debt of unresolved issues I’ve accumulated is unforgiving and it seems as though each day the interest only compounds more and more.</p><p>I do recognize the selfishness in my need to temporarily push people and the world away in order to regain some intense sense of identity. At a time when there’s so much societal pressure to be active and take part in what you perceive as right, I find myself having to draw back even more. I do wonder if the world could benefit from more tolerance and trust in people to come to their own courses of action at the time they feel ready. But I also acknowledge readiness is subjective in both its definition and who deserves to determine when any individual is, and that sometimes people aren’t to be trusted on their internal sense of balance on matters of urgency and crucial timing. I am in full awareness of that with a wonky internal sense of balance myself.</p><p>I earnestly hope writing this will help me writhe a bit from the cast I’ve forced myself in, this sense of paralysis from my thoughts, ideas, and tasks that have melded together to produce the fog of overwhelm that has clouded my vision. I’ve been feeling so shut down; even jotting down these thoughts in a more cohesive format have helped bring back from deep slumber a part of me who tirelessly works to analyze and make sense of things that has run away because of the sensory overload. </p><p>I do feel guilt, and fear in setting my boundaries out of the lack of understanding in other people in that I need more time or perhaps resolution than what may be considered normal. Yet I have come to terms with the fact that it is a gradual but necessary step in figuring out the traits of myself that fuel this need, to shift these cogs to fit a working long-term operational model that lets me take in the day-to-day without incurring so much clutter. I will need to reflect on my intake from the world and on how I can cut down the sources to what I find fulfilling and meaningful. Regaining balance will be a balancing act in itself of being patient with myself in regaining my sense of inner peace and identity, and urging myself not to stew too much in it so as for it to mutate into a never-ending juggle of trying to make sense of a series of never-ending events in a world of chaos that will perpetually stay that way.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[equals]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>It's one thing to feel the fulfillment of truly looking after a loved one.<br>It's something else altogether to feel fulfilled by someone who truly looks after you.</p><p><br>No matter how the future pans out, these emotions are ones I want to wholeheartedly capture, and etch into my mind.</p><p><em><a href="https://society6.com/product/blossom-hug_mini-art-print">Source</a></em></p>]]></description><link>https://nomadsinwhitespace.com/equals/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5e5cab7f1d4f22c8100539d2</guid><category><![CDATA[Happy]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nyan Tun]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2020 06:47:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://nomadsinwhitespace.com/content/images/2020/03/equals.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://nomadsinwhitespace.com/content/images/2020/03/equals.jpg" alt="equals"><p>It's one thing to feel the fulfillment of truly looking after a loved one.<br>It's something else altogether to feel fulfilled by someone who truly looks after you.</p><p><br>No matter how the future pans out, these emotions are ones I want to wholeheartedly capture, and etch into my mind.</p><p><em><a href="https://society6.com/product/blossom-hug_mini-art-print">Source</a></em></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[quiet]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I'm glad I made the decision to get far away from the city to gain some clarity, away from all the issues and unease that has been haunting me for the past few months.

It even feels like I've left my emotional baggage physically behind. I know escape isn't a sustainable solution, but I cherish my time here, and to an extent, I really wish I didn't have to go back. </p><p>These days I'm coming to remember the importance of quiet and not just in the literal sense. I've missed this sense of tranquility, the mind void of dwelling or unmet desire. I'm appreciative of the time I have left here, in contact with fewer people, fewer social media apps, fewer distractions. I am truly thankful for it all, the clear blue skies, the gentle breeze, the warm rays of sunlight.</p><p>I had a glimpse of this zen during my meditation program this summer. Somehow in the midst of all the problems that came after I lost a lot of what I had been taught. </p><p>Moving forward, I want to foster this sense of quiet when I return to my normal schedule. I want to spend more time in the enjoyment of solitude, and have more collected periods of self-reflection. I'm getting more clarity by the day but I need to give myself time and grow accustomed to more peace and quiet outside so that I can develop them within. I am going to try to slow down my lifestyle and live a more intentional lifestyle to get there.</p><p>I'm growing to remember how soothing the sound of silence can be.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[happiness]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><em>A Zen master was given a beautifully crafted crystal cup.

If all things are judged by the extent to which they depart from a baseline of past experience, gradually even the most positive events will cease to have impact as they themselves are absorbed into the new baseline against which further events are judged. Thus, as lottery winners become accustomed to the additional pleasures made possible by their new wealth, these pleasures should be experienced as less intense and should no longer contribute very much to their general level of happiness." - <a href="https://pages.ucsd.edu/~nchristenfeld/Happiness_Readings_files/Class 3 - Brickman 1978.pdf">Lottery Winners and Accident Victims: Is Happiness Relative?</a></blockquote><img src="https://nomadsinwhitespace.com/content/images/2019/12/Pavlov-Corbis_o.jpg" alt="emotion resistance training"><p>I can see the justification that it may be inconsiderate or socially unacceptable for those with such few burdens to bear, issues to worry about to wear a low baseline of happiness on their sleeves. After all, a vast majority of the world's population endures so much more the former may not even be able to fathom. Though controversial, I can also understand the pleas of emptiness, numbness in those raised in privileged environments. Can they really be put to blame for the backgrounds they inherited through fate?</p><p>The less you have, the higher the capacity for novelty in your life. The more the possibility for exciting new thrills, for sights and sounds so grandiose they may seem fictional, for experiences that make you tear up dumbfounded. A child gazes at a waterfall differently than a well-travelled adult does. The first taste of sushi tastes worlds apart from that of the hundredth, thousandth bite.</p><p>Emotions hit us less hard as we age, as we encounter similar experiences repeatedly and become more well-versed in the many facets of life. I guess this explains the loss of a childlike sense of wonder in adults as we feel and process more and more of the entire emotion spectrum. Some of us endure great periods of grief and melancholy, some of us snooze in comfort coasting through life with little to no challenge at all. Those in the former, despite their hardships, have much to look forward to, to aspire towards, to hope whereas those in the latter, undeniably fortunate, do not have this privilege. Those who "have it all", particularly through circumstance at a younger age, may feel a sense of hopelessness for the lack of experiences left to live, for the loss of excitement for a new day, if they've already enveloped much of what life has to offer. </p><p>I'd like to stay optimistic and hope that there is no way a person may go through every nook and cranny of emotions and experiences life has to offer. Two trips to a country may evoke completely different emotional responses from one to another. A part of me though is skeptical. Sometimes a successive trip abroad seems not as exhilarating only because it is no longer the inaugural. A following visit to a restaurant may no longer feel as astonishing simply because of this lack of novelty.</p><p>Is this emotion dilution inevitable for us all?</p><p>Considering intense emotions strongly associated with happiness, relationships come to mind. In the realm of romance too, will the thrill, the infatuation in a relationship after the first be less intense, less fluttering than the foremost? Entering this new and exciting notion of a relationship, our happiness soars. We have the time of our lives, try to adjust and balance all these feelings of obsession, sleeplessness, pure unadulterated joy cherishing this new person deeply entrenched in the our lives, compassionate about us in incredible capacity.</p><p>Even before the next, within the span of a single relationship, as we become more accustomed to all these sensations and feelings, do these feelings become more diluted over time, regardless of who the significant other is? Do we stop valuing it as much, stop valuing how much they care, how much they matter? After the initial euphoria in a first love, have we depleted our potential for the purest form of an intensely charged first love for the rest of our lives?</p><p>Part of me is accepting of this bittersweet fact, that the anticipation, the fervor, the anguish of a first love are emotions that are once-in-a-lifetime, that memories will last but emotions will come, be felt, and then fade away forever. Ephemerality gives these moments meaning. Part of me is even grateful for emotion dilution; we end up becoming more resistant towards not just positive but also negative stimuli, transitioning our personalities toward more disaffected but collected ones.</p><p>Maybe what I call emotion dilution is just what others have been calling wisdom all along.</p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[do understand]]></title><description><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Everything here represents brief periods of lowest lows and highest highs.</p>

It is unlike a sharp but fleeting bee sting, but a sort of dull ache, one that lingers on and on incessantly. It saps your energy during the day and exchanges your capacity to escape away into your dreams at night with an insufferable gift of unwelcome restlessness. It drains away your capacity for compassion until you're left with a silhouette of a person, devoid of all characteristics human. It is a horrible feeling, grief.</p><p>But I think I do tend to romanticize grief, and may even resonate better with those of us who have fared into the lower deep ends of the happiness spectrum.  I find it is often than not the case that who have overcome periods of grief end up being more compassionate, more tolerant, with a tinge of melancholic wisdom that allows them to be more empathetic when others encounter pain of similar or less intensity, and recognize that no matter how hopeless a situation may seem to be when viewed locally, time and tide wait for no man.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[intimacy]]></title><description><![CDATA[<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Sometimes I wish I could read your mind.<br>
