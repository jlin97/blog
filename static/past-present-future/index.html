                <div class="kg-card-markdown"><p>Had a fun reunion. I really had a lot of fun; actually it's been a really long time since I've had this type of carefree attitude. I feel guilty as this is 9th week but I still think that it is all worth it. I have to say that comparing my high school to college friends:</p>
<p>High school friends are definitely less stressed out. Maybe it's because it's their holiday but we basically just caught up on our experiences in college, how we've changed, how life in America has been, and reminiscing about our childhood years. Some of them I've known for so long and fuck I never would have expected this group to have stayed this close for so long. I'm so glad they took the time and money out to fly over, even if I don't completely share their worldview of pursuing happiness and peace in life. It was surreal how we were having a 4 am discussion in a balcony in LA talking about the tidal changes of life from growing up in Myanmar, going to middle school and high school in a school like ours, and how each of the friends in our group have adapted to adult life. With these friends, I feel a sense of letting go, of returning to my childish roots, letting loose and just having fun. We are profligate but we're accumulating life experiences. We're more open to a wide variety of activities because of the lack of repercussion for any of the decisions we've made thus far, moral or not, that allow us to be more adventurous, open-minded. These friends might not seem like they will go the farthest in life, or have a concrete vision for what will happen in their futures, but they have no pressure to. There's a safety net to fall back on if our plans don't go our way. We share a multilayered sense of humor derived from years of friendship, and knowledge of how each of us changed from childhood to adolescence to adulthood that I think cannot be shared with any other group.</p>
<p>With college friends, they're more mature. They've been brought up with the mindset that it's up to them to figure out their way in life with nobody to fall back on if things don't work out and there's a chronic sense of worry that lingers on all the time. I'm close to them too, in ways I can't relate to with my high school friends such as our academics, our intellectual conversations and our major in a different way. They have a curiosity for intellectual stimulation that I can't find in my friends from back home. Conversations with them are more adult-like, yet more restrained. Each of us thinks before we talk, and I can sense a disparity in sensitivity and intellect, in the extent to which they understand the ideas and concepts I try to convey. They're not as open to trying out new things as my high school friends are but out of different moral values that I don't completely understand. They're so much more hardworking, and will probably go further in life if we all started off on the same footing. What I can relate to though is the need for achievement that my high school friends may have let go of after enduring not only the shift in difficulty from our joke of a high school to university but the culture shock as well, that motivates each of my college friends. My old friends and I are probably spoiled and out of touch with reality compared to these friends which allows for me to learn and try to take in a different perspective, and hear about stories and problems I would otherwise never be exposed to. My college friends can be boring people at times but sometimes a mundane lifestyle of routine and discipline is sometimes what you need for self-made success in the long term. My fear is that these friends will end up being slaves of the system after graduation as their upbringing has made it so, so that they have been conditioned to following the norms of society and its expectations as an absolute guide to life.</p>
<p>I'm in the middle of two worlds, and I'm trying to get the best of both.</p>
